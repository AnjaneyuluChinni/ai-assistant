- Typewriting effect for chat-related content

**Interactive Elements**
- Coming Soon

**Behind-the-Scenes**
- Four prompt options that provide a different context to the chat - allowing for quick coding assistance (users can drop a code snippet without providing any details and the chat will know what to do)
- Built-in chat commands that provides the user with the ability to use the website without using the mouse to trigger click events and to access additional information about the website and its features and limitations
- User submitted code snippets and inputs are encoded and appended to predefined prompts before request is sent to the API
- Chat history between user and AI can be saved to browser storage and handled via the toolbar
- Allow chat history to be downloaded to a styled `.html` file with the filename including the website name and date of download
- Time from request initiation to response is calculated to give users insight to the AI's performance
- Ability to download the website as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) allowing users to use the features like a native application on desktops or mobile devices
- Syntax highlighting is added dynamically as they are recieved by the AI
- Typewriter effect with custom cursor created with the assistance of `setTimeout()` and `substring()` methods
